# What is this repo

My shader sensei : https://github.com/GarrettGunnell

As a huge fan of Acerola, I decided to make URP version of his works. (His works are based on built-in pipeline.)
I first watch his video, get the idea and try to implement my self, then give up and copy paste his repo.
So the code here may/may not differ from Acelora's.

Unity 2022.3.0, URP version is 14.0.7

# Finished
